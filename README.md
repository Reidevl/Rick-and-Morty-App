# RickAndMortyApp

This project was developed to practice and learning a bit more about how to use publics API.

In this example I used the Rick and Morty's API and I created two views:
1.- A characters list view and;
2.- A character details view.

Also I added a Search component to filter character by its name.

My intention is to create a PWA with this example.
